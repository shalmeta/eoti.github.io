"LAST YEAR, **** ******* WAS PLACED IN A SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM CALLED QUIET SKIES SUBJECT TO INTRUSIVE SEARCHES, FOLLOWED BY BOMB SNIFFING DOGS AND TRAILED BY THREE FEDERAL AIR MARSHALS PER FLIGHT. TO COVER THE STORY I CONTACTED THE TSA. THEY MADE NO COMMENT ON THE MAIN QUESTION ABOUT THE TRUTH OF THE STORY BUT ADDED, AS IF IN MITIGATION, QUOTE, SIMPLY MATCHING TO A RISK-BASED RULE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE DEROGATORY INFORMATION ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL. THAT'S BUREAUCRAT-ESE FOR SAYING, WE DO THIS EVEN TO INNOCENT PEOPLE. BEFORE QUIET SKIES WAS DISCONTINUED BY THE ADMINISTRATION THERE WAS A SYMBOL -- STEEP DECLINE IN FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT SINCE 9/11. THE GOVERNMENT FOLLOWED UP TO 50 PEOPLE PER DAY THAT IN -- FOR A PROGRAM THAT IN ITS HISTORY NEVER LED TO A SINGLE ARREST OR THWARTED A SINGLE TERRORIST ATTACK. DESPITE ITS GREAT CIVIL LIBERTIES CONCERN IT WAS REFUNDED YEAR AFTER YEAR. OUR GOVERNMENT GATHERS INFORMATION ON ITS OWN CITIZENS AS AN END IN ITSELF. IN A WEEK IN WHICH THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER FEDERAL SECURITY OFFICIALS ALWAYS TELL THE TRUTH TO CONGRESS'S BACK IN THE NEWS IT IS WORTH NOTING IT HAS NOW BEEN 13 YEARS SINCE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR JAMES CLYBURN ANSWERED NO SIR AND NOT WITTINGLY WHEN ASKED DOES THE NSA COLLECT ANY DATA AT ALL ON HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS? CLAPPER LATER EXPLAINED HE HAD RESPONDED IN THE LEAST MOST UNTRUTHFUL MANNER IF YOU LIE ABOUT MASS SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS, EVEN UNDERGROWTH, YOU NOT ONLY GET TO KEEP YOUR JOB, YOU GET TO BE HIRED AS A PROFESSIONAL TRUTH TELLER AFTER RETIREMENT AS A NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST FOR CNN. IF YOU TRY TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SAME ISSUES YOUR OPTIONS ARE PRESENT OR LEAVING THE COUNTRY FOREVER. IN THOSE 13 YEARS, AMERICANS HAVE BECOME NUMB TO SURVEILLANCE. IT WAS ONCE A CORE PRINCIPLE THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT OR SHOULD NOT -- SPY ON CITIZENS WITHOUT PREDICATION AND NOW THE COUNTRY EXCEPT AS INEVITABLE THE IDEA THAT EVERY MOVE WE MAKE IS RECORDED AND ANALYZED. WE KNOW THAT EMAILS AND PHONE CONVERSATIONS, AT MINIMUM, ARE BEING ELECTED PASSIVELY AND THE MOUNTAINS OF DATA WE LEAVE ONLINE FROM GEOLOCATION OF CELL PHONES, TO TRAVEL, BANKING, AND MEDICAL RECORDS ARE INCREASINGLY FODDER FOR COVERT OR OVERT ACQUISITION BY FEDERAL ANALYSTS. GOOGLE ADMITTED THAT THEY PARTNER WITH COMPANIES NOT JUST TO MONITOR SPEECH, BUT SUPPRESS IT ON A GRAND SCALE. QUIET SKIES WAS AN EXAMPLE OF A PROGRAM THAT COULD TAKE ENDLESS LIBERTIES WITH THE CONSTITUTION -- BECAUSE IT WAS SECRET.

    >>> WHEN YOU GATHER INFORMATION WITH NO INTENTION OF EVER GOING TO COURT, YOU NEVER HAVE TO JUSTIFY YOURSELF TO A JUDGE. THIS LEADS TO A LOT OF WHAT ONE COURT RECENTLY CALLED THE EXACT SORT OF GENERAL EXPLORATORY RUMMAGING THE FOURTH AMENDMENT WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT. THIS IS A BETRAYAL, NOT JUST OF THE PUBLIC, BUT OF PEOPLE LIKE MR. ******* WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED FOR IMPORTANT WORK BUT FORCED TO DO INTELLIGENCE WORK AND GATHER INFORMATION ON CITIZENS INSTEAD.<<<

    AS A FORMER MARSHALL MACLEAN PUT IT TO ME, THE AIR MARSHALS JOB IS TO PROTECT THE COCKPIT AND THE PILOTS. LET SOMEBODY ELSE TO THE INTELLIGENCE. ONE FBI AGENT I INTERVIEWED A FEW YEARS AGO SAID THE DISTINCTION THAT -- BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE BAD THOUGHTS AND PEOPLE WHO DO BAD THINGS HAS BEEN COMPLETELY LOST IN OUR GOVERNMENT SINCE 9/11. WHEN YOU START DOWN THE ROAD OF COLLECTING INFORMATION ON INNOCENT PEOPLE, IT CREATES AN INTELLECTUAL JUSTIFICATION FOR DOING IT AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN. ALL OF THE INFORMATION GATHERED REVERSES THE NATURAL POLITICAL ORDER, GIVING ELECTED OFFICIALS UNDESERVED AND UNEARNED POWER OVER THEIR BOSSES, US, THE VOTERS. IT IS TIME TO STOP BEING NUMB TO THIS OUTRAGE. LET'S HOPE THE ELIMINATION OF QUIET SKIES IS JUST THE BEGINNING. THANK YOU."
